# PizzaManagementApp
Manage Pizzas and Toppings
This repository only has the MVC files (which contain the C# code/logic that I used), DataContext and migrations to show how I got the web app/database to its current state.
All other files are autogenerated when using the frameworks.

What I used locally:
Visual Studio 2022
.NET Core 3.1 Framework
ASP.NET Core Web App
NuGet Package Manager: Installed Entity Framework SQL Tools and Design

Deployed with Azure
